# ðŸ‘¬ Let's practice pairing!

In pairs you'll receive some index cards with names of things on them.
You'll each take turns asking your partner to draw what's on the card.
The only caveat is you can't tell your partner what is on the card.
You'll have to devise instructions for them to draw shapes.

# Pair Programming

**Pair**. n. Two people who are related in some way or who do something together.
**Programming**. n. The act or job of creating computer programs.

Pair programming is all about programming with someone else.  The main philosophy is that two sets of eyes reduce the overall error rate, increase the speed of development, and increase the rate of learning for both participants.

Typical solo programming involves two major tasks: coming up with ideas which will be converted into code, and entering that code to be run as a program.

Pair programming assigns each of these tasks to two people:

1.  The *navigator* decides the direction the program is currently taking.  Typically this will involve with coming up with functions, classes, algorithms, and so on.  One caveat is that the navigator is not typically allowed to scrap the work of the previous navigator to accomplish their goals.

Students learning to program this way will often, as navigator, be dictating the code to be typed exactly, or nearly exactly.  Choices they make should generally be adhered to by the driver.

2.  The *driver* is at the wheel, or keyboard.  The driverâ€™s main responsibility is to transcribe the code that the navigator is coming up with.

A secondary responsibility of the driver is to keep the navigator in check.  If itâ€™s clear that the navigator is forgetting something important that will prevent the current code from running, itâ€™s the driverâ€™s job to mention it.  Discussion is fine, but the driver shouldnâ€™t be actively coding.  Thatâ€™s the navigatorâ€™s job.

Over time, as you become more comfortable with coding, the navigator will be less about providing explicit code, and will provide instructions like "iterate over the array" trusting that the driver can write that code block without help.

There are two things that can go wrong with pairing:

1. A passive driver is one who, despite having qualms with or not understanding the navigator, does not speak up and blindly moves forward.  If this is your driving technique then often you will be not only left behind, but less likely to contribute as the navigator.

2. An aggressive navigator is one who typically pushes forward without concern for the driverâ€™s experience.  An aggressive navigator has ideas, their ideas are right even if they donâ€™t sync up with the the work done by the driver previously.  The program at the end will be the program that they have written, not the program that the pair has written.
